# KinKeeperApp

Friendly neat title: *Kin Keeper* – your app for keeping track of family, relationships, and meaningful connections.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**KinKeeperApp** is a mobile app built using Flutter (Dart) targeting Android (and potentially iOS) that helps users manage family relationships, genealogy, shared memories, and keep track of their "kin-network".  
It allows users to create profiles for family/relations, link them, maintain a family tree or network graph, add photos/memories, and get notifications / reminders for birthdays, events, etc.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter, Dart  
- **Backend / Storage**: (adjust if applicable — e.g., Firebase Firestore, or custom API)  
- **Supported Platforms**: Android (via Android Studio) — option to support iOS in future  
- **Other Tools**: Git for version control, CI/CD (if applicable), etc  

## ✅ Key Features

- Create and edit a profile for yourself and your family/kin  
- Visualize relationships (family tree or network)  
- Add photos, occasions, memories linked to individuals  
- Reminders for birthdays, anniversaries, important events  
- Secure login / authentication (if implemented)  
- Syncing across devices (if applicable)  

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed (compatible version)  
- Android Studio (or VS Code) for development  
- Android device or emulator for testing  
- (If using Firebase) A Firebase project configured & linked  

### Clone & Run

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/TanmayNerurkar/KinKeeperApp.git

# Go into the project directory
cd KinKeeperApp

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on an Android device/emulator
flutter run
````

### Configuration

* If using Firebase: set up `google-services.json` (for Android) and place it under `android/app/`
* Update any configuration files (e.g., `lib/config.dart`) to your project settings
* For first-time usage: create required Firestore (or database) collections/indexes. (See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` and `FIRESTORE_INDEXES.md`)
